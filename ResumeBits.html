The reason the application was developed is because even in 2010 the idea of paying for an expensive graphing calculator was beginning to get ridiculous. More and more people were beginning to get mobile devices, and a mobile device could handle more powerful computation and give users a much better experience with graphs as they would have a touchscreen. Mathulator was built from the ground up, with every single line of code written by me including my own custom made mathematical computation library. As I learned more and more about Java and computer science in general I realized the design decisions I made in high school, with no computer science education, were non optimal, and the entire application had to be refactored. The new design for the application was 10x as powerful and likely would have removed much of the bottlenecks the application faced. The newly designed application however, is too much for one person to develop, so the project&rsquo;s development halted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Features</span></p><ul class="c3 lst-kix_8b1e278l0n9g-0 start"><li class="c0 c1"><span>Standard mathematical expression evaluation</span></li><li class="c0 c1"><span>Standard set of mathematical functions (sin, cos, abs, ln ect..)</span></li><li class="c0 c1"><span>Numerical derivative evaluation</span></li><li class="c0 c1"><span>Numerical integral evaluation</span></li><li class="c0 c1"><span>Interactive multi function graphing</span></li><li class="c0 c1"><span>Interactive graphed numerical derivatives</span></li><li class="c0 c1"><span>Interactive graphed numerical integrals</span></li><li class="c0 c1"><span>Autocomplete like system for variables and functions when typing</span></li><li class="c0 c1"><span>Analytics reporting statement evaluation times and user engagement</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Light Droid</span></p><p class="c0"><span>2014</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Developed with 3 other students as a senior project for a security company called Lumension, Light Droid is designed to scan throug</span><span>h all applications installed on an Android device as well as scanning device level settings to warn the user about potential security issues. The reason this application was developed is because Android users typically have several applications installed, and checking the permissions used by every application can be a daunting task, as well as the fact that most users aren&rsquo;t aware of security threats such as Wifi spoofing. My part of the development project was building the interface, maintaining proper Java standards on all committed code, and validating the threat detection algorithms. The application&rsquo;s development ended at the end of the semester, though further development of it may continue as a part of future senior projects.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Features</span></p><ul class="c3 lst-kix_oy9slnr3ifah-0 start"><li class="c0 c1"><span>Scans all installed applications and rates their possible threat by comparing their permissions and Google Play download count and ratings</span></li><li class="c0 c1"><span>View more information about an application than is usually easily accessible to the user</span></li><li class="c0 c1"><span>Filter ratings quickly by name</span></li><li class="c0 c1"><span>Scan device level settings and rate the device overall while warning the user about potential security threats</span></li><li class="c0 c1"><span>Manually adjustable weights for each checked permission</span></li><li class="c0 c1"><span>Blacklist/Whitelist applications to automatically be marked as a high level threat or removed entirely from checks.</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Unnamed</span></p><p class="c0"><span>2014</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">A mobile application that can be used to replace maps at theme parks, zoos, campuses and more.

Project Resume was designed from the ground up using the most modern technologies I was aware of, and as such, Project Resume was not only my first real Go project, but also my first Polymer project, and my first AppEngine project. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The frontend</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The frontend, which you are using right now, was built using a Polymer, html5, css3, and Javascript. The frontend speaks with an AppEngine application over a CloudEndpoints based REST service to automatically load the resume&rsquo;s data from the Resume Services based off of the AccessKey given when the front end first loads. The AccessKey can be given as a URL parameter , or entered when the front end loads.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The Backend</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The backend is several CloudEndpoints based REST Apis written in Go. Data objects are stored in Cloud Datastore with an access control list that defines whether or not each item should be shown to a viewer with a specific access key. The service then filters out all of the requested data items and exposes them to the client while stripping the access control list so that the client can&rsquo;t see other parties AccessKeys.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Designing the application in this way allows the resume to automatically customize itself based on the AccessKey provided by hiding objects, and then showing different versions of objects based on the access control list.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">UX Design</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">I am not a User Experience designer. However, I know that a delightful user experience is important in any application. That is why Polymer was chosen for the interface, Polymer makes designing interface that fit the Material Design language very easy.</span></p></body></html>
